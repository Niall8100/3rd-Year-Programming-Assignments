1. Modify last week's assignment to sort the ArrayList of Rational objects using a separate Comparator class (a class that implements java.util.Comparator). The sort() method can take in a second argument as the comparator, which should be an instance of your Comparator class (4 marks).

2. Use Collections.shuffle() to shuffle the list before sorting (2 marks).

3. Modify the program to use the built-in Collections.binarySearch() method to check if a particular fraction, inputted through console, is contained within the list. Print out your results to the console (3 marks).
Use comments to explain your code and keep it simple.  Include your name, ID number and class in each java file as a comment (1 mark).
Submit your program in the format assignment7_firstname_lastname.zip..
