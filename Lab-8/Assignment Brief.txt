Develop a simple GUI-based Java program that may be used to control an electric heater. Use suitable Swing components to allow the heater controller to perform the following functions: 

1. Switch the heater system on or off (2 marks). 

2. Choose a heat intensity level from a list -  Level 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 (2 marks). 

3. Mode of Operation buttons - Manual or Timed (2 marks). 

4. A button that, when pressed, will display the current status (aka: currently selected settings) of the heater in a text field (2 marks).

 

–  Show the top-level design of the GUI, including any Panels and related Layout Manager objects that you propose to use.  

–  For each of the components you’ve chosen above, write the code to construct the component, add the component to a container and then setup simple event handling for the component (for those that generate events). 

–  The event handlers need only print out a message indicating that they have been called.

Include your name, ID and class as a comment in the  java file.   Show the operation of your GUI using snapshots in a pdf/doc file. (2 marks)
