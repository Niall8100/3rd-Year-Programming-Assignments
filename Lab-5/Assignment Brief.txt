1. Write a simple Java program that creates an array of StudentData objects (name, course code, and ID), including a toString override to print out all variables. It then serializes the array (and not the StudentData objects individually) and saves it to a file namedstudentdata.txt. It should then read the array from the file and reconstruct a new array object from this data, and print out each item in the array to the console. (5 marks)

2. Copy and rename these two classes. This time, use custom readObject() and writeObject() override methods in StudentData to read and write the object's variables. Do not use defaultWriteObject or defaultReadObject methods to do this. (2 marks)

3. Unrelated to the previous two parts, write a simple program that uses a RandomAccessFile object to open an ordinary text file and to then append an extra line of content onto the end of the file. (2 marks)
