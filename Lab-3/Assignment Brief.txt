Write a Java class called Rational for performing arithmetic with rational numbers. (A rational no. is a number that can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p,q are integers with q !=0 and p and q have no common divisor) 

Use integer variables to represent the two private variables of the class (i.e. the numerator p and the denominator q) and include the corresponding Getter methods. (1 mark)

Throw an exception through the constructor or setter methods if q=0. (1 mark)

Also provide public methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two rationals, and use the formatted output functions to print out the result to the console. (2 marks)


Write a short driver (test) program that could be used to test your class. Pass the various runtime parameters as strings in the form of x/y. Handle the exception that you threw before appropriately. (1 mark)

Use a StringTokenizer to divide the inputted fractions into numbers. Note that StringTokenizer(string, "//" ) will tokenize the string using backslashes as the divider instead of spaces. (1 mark)

For Eclipse, the runtime (or command line) arguments can be set in the Run Configuration window (Program Arguments).

Use an enhanced for loop to traverse the args[] and store the values for the numerator and the denominator as p and q respectively.



Still in that loop, use the methods created earlier to add/subtract and multiply/divide the current fraction with the first fraction. This rule can be ignored for the first fraction inputted. (2 mark)

Submit the program with snapshots for validation that the program runs properly.

Use commenting to explain the code properly (1 mark).

Also, keep your program simple and elegant (1 mark).

Please submit your code in the format assignment3_firstname_lastname.
